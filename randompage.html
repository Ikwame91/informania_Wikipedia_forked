              The Theory of Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein,
              revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It
              consists of two main theories: Special Relativity and General
              Relativity.
            </p>
         
              Special Relativity, published in 1905, introduced the concept that
              the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating
              observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for
              all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
           
          
              General Relativity, published in 1915, explains gravity as a
              curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It predicts
              phenomena such as the bending of light around massive objects and
              the existence of black holes.
          
            <p>
              The Theory of Relativity has been confirmed by numerous
              experiments and observations and continues to be a cornerstone of
              modern physics.

              February 25th is the anniversary of the discovery of penicillin by
              Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming in 1928. Penicillin, the
              first antibiotic drug, revolutionized medicine and has saved
              millions of lives by effectively treating bacterial infections.

              On this day in history, in 1986, Ferdinand Marcos, the President
              of the Philippines, fled the country following the People Power
              Revolution, ending his 20-year authoritarian rule. The revolution
              marked a triumph of democracy and led to the restoration of
              democratic institutions in the Philippines.
